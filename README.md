# WordTools
Python script to assist in building word puzzles

You'll need one or more \n-separated lists of alpha-only English words like "words_alpha.txt" from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words.

Essentially, the program does three things:

1. It allows you to read in lists of words from files (and/or add and remove individual words of your choosing) to a dictionary of words.
2. It allows you to "explore" words in order to quickly be shown all words in said dictionary which can be created by adding a letter to, removing a letter from, changing a single letter of, or rearranging the letters of the provided word.
3. It allows you to search for word ladders (built from words in said dictionary) that connect two provided words of the same length. (A word ladder is a chain of words where each word is only one letter different from the words above and below it.)

I create puzzle hunts, and this is just something I wrote for myself to help with the construction of word puzzles. Here's one such puzzle that I wrote in 2023 (sans its original plot context and visual formatting):

INSTRUCTIONS:

Across these five word ladders, there are 28 missing words. A list of clues is provided for each, but these are in no particular order - clues from each ladder are mixed together and shuffled! Assemble the nine indicated letters to get the final answer to this puzzle.

LADDERS:

LORE	TEAM	GONE	NULL	DIAL
????	????	????	????	????
??2?	????	????	??4?	????
????	??1?	???9	????	?7??
????	8???	?3??	????	5???
TALE	????	????	6???	????
	    CREW	????	????	????
		        AWAY	VOID	????
